##EcoCollect - Web-Based Garbage Collection System

Our team is excited to introduce "EcoCollect," an innovative web-based garbage collection system developed as part of our third-year, first-semester project in Web Application Development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Designed to streamline the garbage disposal process, EcoCollect offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that promotes proper waste management and environmental awareness.

EcoCollect features a secure User Authentication system, allowing individuals to sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles. Users can update their details, add profile pictures, and perform other CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to maintain their accounts.

EcoCollect stands out with two unique features:

Educational Resources: The platform provides educational videos on proper garbage disposal practices. These videos, which can only be managed by administrators, are accessible to all users, offering valuable knowledge to enhance their waste management practices.

Reward System: EcoCollect incentivizes correct garbage disposal by awarding points to users based on the type of garbage they dispose of. This gamified approach encourages users to participate actively and responsibly in waste management.

The platform also includes a Blog section, featuring articles and pictures about garbage collection. Users can read these posts to gain further insights into effective waste management practices.

Administrators have access to a robust Admin Dashboard, where they can oversee various aspects of the system, including managing educational resources, monitoring user activities, and ensuring the smooth operation of the platform.

Our project's core objective is to make garbage disposal efficient and environmentally friendly, engaging users with educational content and rewarding their efforts to maintain cleanliness. EcoCollect aims to create a positive impact on waste management practices and promote environmental sustainability.
